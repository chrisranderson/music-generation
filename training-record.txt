April 2: one song, not sure about parameters
April 6: all the beethoven songs, 12MB. 

"with 6MB you can easily go up to rnn_size 300 or even more".
Maybe try seq_length longer so it can find dependencies
Could try with lower temperature to get more sane results: 
should change the num_layers to be 2 or 3
